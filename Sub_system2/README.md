# Subsystem 2 - Delay and Layout Optimisation

Above are three different attemps at optimisating the source location and reciever layout. Both the COBYLA and Particle Swarm implementation successfully genereated optimal layouts and source locations.

However, difficulty was had trying to implement a genetic algorythm to generate an optimal layout for a given source. Listed here is an attempt with a minimum required sound pressure level of 0 dB, iterating through 1 generation, with a layout size of 35.
