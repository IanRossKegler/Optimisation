# Optimisation
Optimisation of Dyson Library - DE4 Optimisation Project 

Authors: I. Kegler, K. vd Fluit

This code was used towards a paper outlining an optimisation of the Dyson Library for generalised acoustic performance. Both gradient based and non-gradient based algorithms were used to optimise the material properties of the walls, height of the ceiling, properties of added sound absorbing materials, number of receivers, position of source and receiver layout.

# The Study 

The goal of the study was to generate a novel seating layout for acoustic performance for the Dyson Library. In this model subsystem 1 (SS1) alters material and geometric parameters of the room to optimize its reverberation properties for music and speech. It also generates an optimum number of seated people. This parameter is used directly in the second subsystem (SS2) which generates a source position and layout based on the delay of first order reflections and the sound pressure level (SPL) at the receiver. There is an anticipated trade-off between the number of audience members required (and therefore the size of the layout) and the minimum required SPL.
