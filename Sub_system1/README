# Subsystem 1 - Optimisation
Optimisation of Dyson Library - DE4 Optimisation Project 

Authors: I. Kegler, K. vd Fluit

This code was used towards a paper outlining an optimisation of the Dyson Library for generalised acoustic performance.
# The Study 

The goal of the study was to generate a novel seating layout for acoustic performance for the Dyson Library. The objective of the subsystem focuses on providing a solution to improve the acoustics of the Dyson School Library in terms related to average-squared error reverberation time. 

# Software

Matlab 2018a in addition to Global Optimisation Toolbox https://uk.mathworks.com/products/global-optimization.html

# Fmincon and GlobalSearch

execute [opt_scrit_effKVDF](https://github.com/Kvdf/Optimisation/blob/master/Sub_system1/opt_scrit_effKVDF.m) to run fmincon and GlobalSearch algorithm.

# Gradient Descent 

execute [grad_descentOPTI](https://github.com/Kvdf/Optimisation/blob/master/Sub_system1/grad_descentOPTI.m) to run gradient descent algorithm.
